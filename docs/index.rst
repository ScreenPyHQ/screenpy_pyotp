====================================
ScreenPy PyOTP: A ScreenPy Extension
====================================

Not sure what ScreenPy is?
Check out `ScreenPy's documentation <https://screenpy-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ first!

``screenpy_pyotp`` extends ScreenPy
by providing an Ability
which interacts with `PyOTP <https://github.com/pyauth/pyotp/>`__.
This enables your Actors
to :class:`~screenpy_pyotp.abilities.AuthenticateWith2FA`!

Currently,
that's all this extension does.
It is expected that other extensions
will make use of this ability
in their own actions.
